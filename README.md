# hugo-kicking-the-tires

This repository is a mock portfolio site for personal projects, a resume, etc. The main page, titled Noah's Portfolio lists the pages on the website. Adding /about or /contact or /resume to the end of the url brings a viewer to a new page for the respective information. The information on each page is relatively generic and does not give an actual portfolio. Each step in this hugo site was based on the Kicking the Tires reading. Each step has been committed and pushed to Github, including the Your Turn section.


**How to Run**
Clone the repository in Github into an IDE. 
Use the following commands:

cd portfolio
hugo server
